Armour Institute was founded after minister Frank W. Gunsaulus gave what is now known as the “Million Dollar Sermon.” At a time when higher education was reserved for society’s elite, Mr. Gunsaulus called for the donation of a million dollars to build a school that would prepare students of all backgrounds for leadership roles primarily as engineers in a changing industrial society. Philip Danforth Armour a prominent Chicago meat packer and grain merchant heard Gunsaulus’ call and made the donation. Armour also stipulated that Gunsaulus become the first president of the school, a position Gunsaulus held from the school’s founding in 1890 until his death in 1921. Some innovative inventions that stem from research at ACE are the cell phone, magnetic tape recording, and barcodes.', 'Armour College of Engineering', '1');
