<p>The <span class="bold">Student Event Portal</span> is developed by <a href="http://ankitbhimani.in/" target="_blank" class="bold">Ankit Bhimani</a> to fullfil the final project submission for <span class="bold">ITMD 515 - Advanced Software Programming</span> course based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform,_Enterprise_Edition" target="_blank" class="bold">Java EE</a>.</p>
<p>Ever missed an important event at the university just because you were unaware about it or could not find it on the university website? The project <span class="bold">Student Event Portal</span> is designed to bridge this gap between the university departments, events they are holding and the students. It can be a portal for students to keep themselves updated about the event, its timings and venue, and interact with the event organizers and other students.</p>
<p>The <span class="bold">Student Event Portal</span> is a combination of a management tool and a social platform â€“ management for the University; social for the Students. Students will also receive alerts before an event based on his/her preferences.</p>
